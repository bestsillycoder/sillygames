<p> What Is Murder Mystery 2?</p>
</div>
<div style="color: black;">
<p> Murder Mystery Is A Game That Is In Roblox. It Is One Of The Biggest And Most Popular Games.</p>
<p> Roles:</p>
</div>
<div style="color: red;">
<p> 1. Murderer. </p>
</div>
<div>
 <p> If You're Playing The Game, And You Get This Role, You're Lucky. Your Goal Is To Kill Everyone. Try Not To Get Shot By The Sherrif, Or You Will Lose And Will Have To Wait Until You're Murderer Again. You Can Stab Or Throw Knives To Kill. You Have Perks When You're Murderer. If The Sherrif Shoots You, Unlike The Sherrif, You Don't Drop Your Knife. The Others Win And You Will Lose.</p>
</div>
<div style="color: blue;">
<p> 2. SherrifIf. </p>
</div>
<div>
<p> Sherrif Is A Role Just Like The Murderer Role. Like The Murderer, Only One Person Gets This Role. But Your Goal Is Different. You Need To Save People By Shooting The Murderer. If You Shoot The Wrong Person, You Both Will Die. If The Murderer Stabs You, You Will Die. And If You Reset, You Will Respawn In The Lobby. If You Die, Your Gun Will Drop And Anyone That's Innocent Will Be Able To Get The Gun. If They Win, That Is Considerer A Hero Win. Try Not To Die! </p>
</div>
<div style="color: green;">
<p> 3. Innocent. </p>
</div>
<div>
<p> If You Got This Role, You Shall Know Your Goal Is To Survive. You Can Collect Coins Like The Other Roles, Walk Around, Hide, Wait For The Round To End Or You Can Even Grab The Sherrif's Gun To Attempt To Win After The Sherrif Dies. If The Sherrif Shoots You, You Both Will End Up Dying And Will Respawn. If You Win By Shooting The Murderer After The Sherrif Died, It Is A Hero Win. If The Timer Ends And You Don't Get Stabbed, It Means Innocents Won. </p>
</div>
<div>
<p> DIFFERENT KINDS OF MURDERERS </p>
</div>
<div style="color: gray;">
<p> There Are Many Different Murderers. The Spam Jumper, The Camper, The Teamer, The AFK One, The Exploiter And The Targeter. The Spam Jumper Is The Murderer Who Doesn't Get Their Finger Off Of The Poor Space Bar / Jump Button. They Are Also Called Kangaroos Because Of How Much They Jump. The Camper Is The One Who Guards The Sherrif's Gun, Standing On Top Of The Dead Body, Not Allowing Anyone To Get The Gun. The Teamer Always Finds A Friend As A Partner Then They Team Together. People Who Team Are Minimum 2 People. Maximum Can Be Anything. The AFK (Away From Keyboard) One Never Moves, Talks Or Anything. They Might Get The Role But They Don't Do Anything But Stand Still Like The Weird Useless Statues In My Country. The Exploiter Is A Kind Of A Cheater. They Use Exploits (Hacks) To Fly, Jump Higher, Walk Through Walls, Be Faster And Etc. Some Can Also Respawn In The Lobby Because Of Their Hacks. Last But Not Least, We Have The Targeter. The Targeter Chooses Anybody As Their Target, And Then Starts Chasing Them Until They Die. These Targeters Will Love To Make Your Fingers Sore Because Of Walking Non-Stop! You Will Love Them So Much That You Will (TOTALLY..) Jokingly Yell "STOP CHASING AND TARGETING ME!!!".
</div>
<div style="color: black;">
<p> Is There Anything Else I Can Possibly Do In This Game?</p>
</div>
<div style="color: gray;">
<p> Yes, You Can Try To Level Up, Get Lots Of Skins, Unbox New Things, Spend Your Money In The Shop Or Trade! To Trade You Must Be Level 10 Or Higher. Every 100 Levels, You Can Prestige! For Example, If You Reached Level 100, And You Prestige, Instead It Will Show Up As "I (any number from 1-100)".
